# Alzheimer MRI Classification (Educational Project)

This repository contains a step-by-step educational project for detecting whether a brain MRI image indicates Alzheimer’s disease (dementia) or not.

- Basics of medical image processing (preprocessing, normalization, simple enhancement)
- How to prepare MRI images for machine learning / deep learning
- How to build a simple classification pipeline (Alzheimer vs. non-Alzheimer)

The project will start very simple and grow gradually, with each step added as a separate commit.
